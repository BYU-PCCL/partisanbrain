This is the first hyper-cube experiment, where we are doing several exemplar 
runs and several instance runs and also incrementing n_instances_per_category
and n_exemplars. We hope to observe a lot less variance in incrementing 
exemplars by keeping the set constant as we add marginal exemplars, instead
of drawing entirely new sets.
